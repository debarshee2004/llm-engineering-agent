## Overview

This repository contains a powerful coding assistant application build by [Pietro Schirano](https://github.com/Doriandarko) and heavy customized by me to integrate with the LLM APIs to process user conversations and generate structured JSON responses. Through an intuitive command-line interface, it can read local file contents, create new files, and apply diff edits to existing files in real time.

## Local Setup

Step 01. Clone the repo

```bash
https://github.com/debarshee2004/llm-engineering-agent.git
cd llm-engineering-agent
```

Step 02. Install the Packages

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
